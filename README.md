### React Soccer Project

Super big fan of soccer and wanted to make a quick little web app to be able to follow all the major european leagues.

I found a free api which was nice, since the majority you have to pay for. Due to that, some of the data is not always accurate or is updated slowly.


### Technologies Used

React 
Redux 
Bootstrap
Html
CSS
Javascript
Firebase
