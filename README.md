## About

Super big fan of soccer and wanted to make a quick little web app to be able to follow all the major european leagues.

I found a free api which was nice, since the majority you have to pay for. Due to that, some of the data is not always accurate or is updated slowly.


## Technologies Used

- React 
- Redux 
- Bootstrap
- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
- Firebase

### Want to work on...

First and foremost, I want to work with a different API. Unfortunately all of the good ones cost quite a bit so I don't know if I will upgrade unless I find a way to monetize it.

I also would like to add a way for users to be able to save their favorite leagues and follow players
